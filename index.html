        <div class="container ">The origin of the word ikigai goes back to the Heian period (794 to 1185). Clinical
            psychologist and avid expert of the ikigai evolution, Akihiro Hasegawa released a research paper in 2001
            where he wrote that the word “gai” comes from the word “kai” which translates to “shell” in Japanese.

            During the Heian period, shells were extremely valuable, so the association of value is still inherently
            seen in this word. It can also be seen in similar Japanese words like hatarakigai, (働きがい) which means the
            value of work, or yarigai ~ga aru (やり甲斐がある), meaning “it’s worth doing it.</div>

            <h2 class="heading">Where is ikigai practiced?</h2>
            <p>Okinawa, the southern island off of mainland Japan, is home to one of the highest ratios of centenarians
                to population. Okinawa is also a hotbed of ikigai ideology. Here the mild weather, healthy diet, and low
                level of stress are also factors, but it’s the island’s active population of non-retiring,
                purpose-driven residents that links them to other long-living communities in Sardinia, Italy and Icaria,
                Greece.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"If you can find pleasure and satisfaction in what you do and you’re good at it, congratulations you have
                found your ikigai."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="heading">What’s your ikigai?</h2>
            <p>In his book, Garcia says that studying the ikigai ideology has changed the way he shapes his day.

                “I have improved my morning routine to start my days doing what is most important to me before getting
                busy with others.” In other words, he prioritizes the duties that give him purpose. “This means that I
                have a cup of green tea, do 15 minutes of easy yoga poses and then write for one hour. Before leaving
                home, I have dedicated time to my health and one of the activities that give ikigai to my life: which is
                writing books.”

                Though it may sound career-focused, ikigai is not always about financial endeavors. Having a hobby that
                you can dedicate your time to, raising a family, or being able to work and make steps towards diving
                deep into that passion project you’ve always fantasized about, are all ikigai.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Finding your ikigai</h2>
            <p>If you’re feeling lost or unsure about what your ikigai is, there are a number of ways to refocus your
                mind and purpose.

                “If you find yourself blocked because change is difficult, try adding some new thing to your life: a new
                hobby, new circle of friends, or a new job on the side,” Garcia suggests.

                Tokyo-based neuroscientist, writer, and broadcaster Ken Mogi argues in his 2017 book, The Little Book of
                Ikigai: The Essential Japanese Way to Finding Your Purpose in Life, that it doesn’t matter whether “you
                are a cleaner of the famous Shinkansen bullet train, the mother of a newborn child or a Michelin-starred
                sushi chef’ – if you can find pleasure and satisfaction in what you do and you’re good at it,
                congratulations you have found your ikigai.”</p>
